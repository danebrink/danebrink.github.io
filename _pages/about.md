I am an Economics PhD student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My interests lie in Trade and Industrial Organization, with a particular focus on implications of multinational firms. 

Prior to the PhD program, I completed my undergraduate and masters degree in econometrics at the University of Pretoria, and was a predoctoral fellow at Yale University. 

I have extensive experience in using and creating South African tax administrative data. I am looking to partner with local organizations in South Africa to help facilitate and pool data resources.
