Welcome to my website! I am an Economics PhD student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My interests lie in Trade and applied econometrics.

Before the PhD program, I completed my undergraduate and master's degrees in econometrics at the University of Pretoria and was a predoctoral fellow at Yale University. I have also worked as a research assistant at the National Treasury of South Africa and [Economic Research Southern Africa](https://econrsa.org/), where I helped build the matched employer-employee and customs tax database. If you want more information on using this data, please feel free to contact me or the [program coordinators](https://sa-tied.wider.unu.edu/data). 

I am looking to partner with local organisations in South Africa to help facilitate and pool data resources for impactful research.
