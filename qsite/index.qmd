Welcome! I am a PhD student in Economics at the University of Michigan. My interests lie in International Trade, Macroeconomics, and Applied Econometrics. Before starting my PhD, I helped build the administrative tax database at the National Treasury of South Africa, where I worked with the UN, World Bank, and Economic Research Southern Africa. I also spent a year at Yale University as part of the Tobin Centre Predoc program.
